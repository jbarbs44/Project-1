# Project-1
Project Title
    Airbnb Rental Prices & Home Values across the US

Project Summary
    For the project, we are taking US airbnb data and looking for the average price of the rental by city and by state. We are trying to see if there is any positive or negative relationships within the airbnb data set and the columns provided. We want to see based on our data set which cities had the most listings. We are also taking Zillow home value data and seeing how the home values compare to the airbnb rental prices.
